Role Name
=========

This role makes sure the default locales are generated and configured.

Requirements
------------


Role Variables
--------------

Role variables are documented inline in the following files:
- Required variables in meta/main.yml
- Optional variables in defaults/main.yml
- Constants in vars/main.yml

Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope
(ie. hostvars, group vars, etc.) should be mentioned here.

Dependencies
------------

Example Playbook
----------------

Including an example of how to use your role (for instance, with variables
passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

    - hosts: servers
      roles:
         - locale
